Hi there! I'm Jibin Thomas, a passionate Frontend Developer based in Mumbai, India. With over 5+ years of professional experience, I have honed my skills in creating exceptional web experiences. Currently, I am working at Pepper Content, where I contribute to building awesome web applications.


When I'm not immersed in the world of code, I have a few other tricks up my sleeve. I enjoy playing FPS games and chess, diving into fictional books, and indulging in Netflix binges. Oh, and I also maintain a casual blog where I share my learnings and insights.

Feel free to reach out to me through the following channels:
- Portfolio **[jibin.tech](https://jibin.tech)**
- Twitter **[@real_jibin](https://twitter.com/real_jibin)**
- Linkedin **[https://www.linkedin.com/in/jibin2706](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jibin2706)**

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions. Let's connect and create something amazing together!

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. Have a great day!
